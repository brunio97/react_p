StayHealthy conducted an extensive survey to assess the medical facilities available inremote areas and found that several patients have a tough time finding the right doctor atthe right time. There are usually no doctors or hospitals within a 50-mile radius, or thewait time to meet a doctor is too long. Many times, this has resulted in life-threateningemergencies or lost lives.
With the internet and broadband availability increasing in remote areas, the initiativefrom StayHealthy will help get patients access to general physicians and specialists atthe right time easily.
